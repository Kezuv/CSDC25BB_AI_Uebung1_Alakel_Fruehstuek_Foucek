CSDC25BB - AI - Exercise 1
Alakel Ibrahim, Fuehstueck Manuel, Foucek Armin



The main method is in StatisticEvaluation.py.

Please define a seed and an amount of puzzles that should be solved in the main method.
The puzzles will be created by a random puzzle generator, which outcome is influenced by the seed.

The program will start the heuristic function one by one for each solution. Starting by Hamming, than Euclidean and
last but not least, Manhattan.

Please make sure that the project directory is declared as your working directory.
A directory statisticOutputs/Seed_X_PuzzleCount_Y should be created in the project
where you can find your statistical output as csv-files.

Ibrahim, Manuel and Armin.
